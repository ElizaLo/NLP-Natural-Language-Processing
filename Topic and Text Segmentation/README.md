|[Unsupervised Topic Segmentation of Meetings with BERT Embeddings](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/unsupervised-topic-segmentation-of-meetings)|<p>Topic segmentation of meetings is the task of dividing multi-person meeting transcripts into topic blocks. Supervised approaches to the problem have proven intractable due to the difficulties in collecting and accurately annotating large datasets. In this paper we show how previous unsupervised topic segmentation methods can be improved using pre-trained neural architectures. We introduce an unsupervised approach based on BERT embeddings that achieves a 15.5% reduction in error rate over existing unsupervised approaches applied to two popular datasets for meeting transcripts.</p><ul><li> ðŸ“„ **Paper** [Unsupervised Topic Segmentation of Meetings with BERT Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12978v1)</li><li> :octocat: [Unsupervised Topic Segmentation of Meetings with BERT Embeddings](https://github.com/gdamaskinos/unsupervised_topic_segmentation)</li></ul>|
|[A Neural Model for Text Segmentation](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)|Text segmentation is the task of dividing a document of text into coherent and semantically meaningful segments which are contiguous. This task is important for other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like summarization, context understanding, and question-answering. The goal of this project is to successfully implement a text segmentation algorithm. We take a supervised learning approach to text segmentation and propose a neural model for this task. We aim to extend this task to podcasts by using existing transcription services. Our model obtained a Pk score (described below) of 6.54 on the Wiki-50 dataset, which was an improvement over our baseline score of 69.23. In this paper we will discuss experiments with self-attention as a modification to our model.|

Text segmentation deals with the correct division of a document into semantically coherent blocks.
