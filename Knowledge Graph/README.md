## Knowledge Graph vs Ontology

### What is the difference?

A knowledge base (KB) is fact-oriented but ontology is schema-oriented.

KB: In the Google KGraph, you have certainly a schema (like the one described by DBPedia, Freebase, etc.) and a set of facts (A relation B, "Paris isA City, Paris hasInhabitants 2M, Paris isCapitalOf France, France isA Country, etc.). So, we can (easily) answer to questions like "Number of inhabitants in Paris?" or you can provide a short description of Paris, France (or any given entity in general).

The domain ontology tells people which are the main concepts of a domain, how are these concepts related and which attributes do they have. Here the focus is on the description, with the highest possible expressiveness (disjointness, values restrictions, cardinality restrictions) and the useful annotations (synonyms, definition of terms, examples, comments on design choices, etc.), of the entities of a given domain. Data (or facts) are not the main concern when designing a domain ontology VS KB.

## What is the difference between a Knowledge Graph and a Graph Database?

Knowledge graphs are data. They have to be stored, managed, extended, quality-assured and can be queried. This requires databases and components on top, which are usually implemented in the Semantic Middleware Layer. This ‘sits’ on the database and at the same time offers service endpoints for integration with third-party systems.

Thus graph databases form the foundation of every knowledge graph. Typically, these are technologies based either on the **Resource Description Framework (RDF)**, a W3C standard, or on Labeled Property Graphs (LPG).

In order to roll out knowledge graphs in companies, however, more than a database is required: Only with the help of components such as taxonomy and ontology editors, entity extractors, graph mappers, validation, visualization and search tools, etc. can it be ensured that a knowledge graph can be sustainably developed and managed. While graph databases are typically maintained by highly qualified data engineers or Semantic Web experts, the interfaces of the Semantic Middleware also allow people to interact with the knowledge graph who can contribute less technical knowledge instead of business and expert knowledge to the graphs.

|[Enriching BERT with Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Document Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08402) | In this paper, we focus on the classification of books using short descriptive texts (cover blurbs) and additional metadata. Building upon BERT, a deep neural language model, we demonstrate how to combine text representations with metadata and knowledge graph embeddings, which encode author information. Compared to the standard BERT approach we achieve considerably better results for the classification task. For a more coarse-grained classification using eight labels we achieve an F1- score of 87.20, while a detailed classification using 343 labels yields an F1-score of 64.70. We make the source code and trained models of our experiments publicly available.|
|[INTERPRETING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH RELATION REPRESENTATION FROM WORD EMBEDDINGS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11611.pdf)|Many models learn representations of knowledge graph data by exploiting its low-rank latent structure, encoding known relations between entities and enabling unknown facts to be inferred. To predict whether a relation holds between entities, embeddings are typically compared in the latent space following a relation-specific mapping. Whilst their predictive performance has steadily improved, how such models capture the underlying latent structure of semantic information remains unexplained. Building on recent theoretical understanding of word embeddings, we categorise knowledge graph relations into three types and for each derive explicit requirements of their representations. We show that empirical properties of relation representations and the relative performance of leading knowledge graph representation methods are justified by our analysis.|

|[Exploiting Knowledge Graph to Improve Text-based Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622123)|As a special kind of "big data," text data can be regarded as data reported by human sensors. Since humans are far more intelligent than physical sensors, text data contains useful information and knowledge about the real world, making it possible to make predictions about real-world phenomena based on text. As all application domains involve humans, text-based prediction has widespread applications, especially for optimization of decision making. While the problem of text-based prediction resembles text classification when formulated as a supervised learning problem, it is more challenging because the variable to be predicted may not be directly derivable from the text and thus there is a semantic gap between the target variable and the surface features that are often used for representing text data in conventional approaches. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by using knowledge graph to construct more effective features for text representation. We propose a two-step filtering algorithm to enhance such a knowledge-aware text representation for a family of entity-centric text regression tasks where the response variable can be treated as an attribute of a group of central entities. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by using two revenue prediction tasks based on reviews. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively leverage knowledge graphs to construct interpretable features, leading to significant improvement of the prediction accuracy over traditional features.|
|[Enhancing explanations in recommender systems with knowledge graphs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918316259)|Recommender systems are becoming must-have facilities on e-commerce websites to alleviate information overload and to improve user experience. One important component of such systems is the explanations of the recommendations. Existing explanation approaches have been classified by style and the classes are aligned with the ones for recommendation approaches, such as collaborative-based and content-based. Thanks to the semantically interconnected data, knowledge graphs have been boosting the development of content-based explanation approaches. However, most approaches focus on the exploitation of the structured semantic data to which recommended items are linked (e.g. actor, director, genre for movies). In this paper, we address the under-studied problem of leveraging knowledge graphs to explain the recommendations with items’ unstructured textual description data. We point out 3 shortcomings of the state of the art entity-based explanation approach: absence of entity filtering, lack of intelligibility and poor user-friendliness. Accordingly, 3 novel approaches are proposed to alleviate these shortcomings. The first approach leverages a DBpedia category tree for filtering out incorrect and irrelevant entities. The second approach increases the intelligibility of entities with the classes of an integrated ontology (DBpedia, schema.org and YAGO). The third approach explains the recommendations with the best sentences from the textual descriptions selected by means of the entities. We showcase our approaches within a tourist tour recommendation explanation scenario and present a thorough face-to-face user study with a real commercial dataset containing 1310 tours in 106 countries. We showed the advantages of the proposed explanation approaches on five quality aspects: intelligibility, effectiveness, efficiency, relevance and satisfaction.|
