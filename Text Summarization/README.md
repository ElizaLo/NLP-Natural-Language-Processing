- You can apply text summarization to **identify key sentences within a document** or **identify key sentences across multiple documents**.
- Text summarization can produce two types of summaries: **extractive** and **abstractive**. 
  - **Extractive** summaries donâ€™t contain any machine-generated text and are a collection of important sentences selected from the input document. 
  - **Abstractive** summaries contain new human-readable phrases and sentences generated by the text summarization model. 
- Most text summarization systems are based on **extractive summarization** because accurate abstractive text summarization is difficult to achieve.
