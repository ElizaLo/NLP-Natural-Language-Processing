Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of correcting different kinds of errors in text such as spelling, punctuation, grammatical, and word choice errors.

GEC is typically formulated as a sentence correction task. A GEC system takes a potentially erroneous sentence as input and is expected to transform it to its corrected version.
