|[Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/)|Uncover valuable insights from text in documents, customer support tickets, product reviews, emails, social media feeds, and more. Simplify document processing workflows by extracting text, key phrases, topics, sentiment, and more from documents such as insurance claims.|
|[Explainable AI for Text Classification](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xolgpdp52ke44)|The solution applies deep learning model (CNN) to classify text data such as reviews and transcripts to identify features leading to prediction of user defined classes. It has explainable AI functionality which helps to understand why the model predicts the class based on key words and phrases in the text. The solution is adaptable and can be trained on any textual dataset containing user defined classes.|
|[Text Classification API](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ztfazwmcw7pxc)|When given text, this API classifies and recommends highly related categories for e-commerce and other uses. Text classification can be used to automatically categorize many articles and texts into our default categories. Enterprise customers can create their own predefined categories. Contact support for more info.|

|[Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET)](https://github.com/timoschick/pet)|This repository contains the code for [Exploiting Cloze Questions for Few-Shot Text Classification and Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07676) and [It's Not Just Size That Matters: Small Language Models Are Also Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07118). The papers introduce pattern-exploiting training (PET), a semi-supervised training procedure that reformulates input examples as cloze-style phrases. In low-resource settings, PET and iPET significantly outperform regular supervised training, various semi-supervised baselines and even GPT-3 despite requiring 99.9% less parameters. The iterative variant of PET (iPET) trains multiple generations of models and can even be used without any training data.|

|[Text Classification (Single Label)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-text-classification.html)|To categorize articles and text into predefined categories, use text classification. For example, you can use text classification to identify the sentiment conveyed in a review or the emotion underlying a section of text. Use **Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth** text classification to have workers sort text into categories that you define.|
