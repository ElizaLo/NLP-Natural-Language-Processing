We looked at three statistical approaches. Term Frequency being the simplest of all, contains a severe drawback of unintelligently focusing on the frequency of the terms. TF-IDF alleviated this issue by incorporating the Inverse Document Frequency to intelligently score the terms not just based on how frequently they occur in a single document but also in the entire corpus. YAKE is a more recent addition to the statistical keyword extractors and provides complex feature engineering in order to score different keywords.|

### GPT-3 Tokenization

- [GPT-3 Online Tokenizer](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer)

Tokenizer for GPT-3 is the same as GPT-2: 🤗 [OpenAI GPT2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#gpt2tokenizerfast).

A helpful rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text. This translates to roughly ¾ of a word (so 100 tokens ~= 75 words).

The GPT-3 model can take as input from 4,000 to 2,000 tokens (**not confused with words!**). GPT-3 generates ~125-140% tokenks from the input text). 
> The text with 2,000 words approximately has 2,800 tokens.

Models understand and process text by breaking it down into tokens. Tokens can be words or just chunks of characters. For example, the word _**“hamburger”**_ gets broken up into the tokens _**“ham”**_, _**“bur”**_ and _**“ger”**_, while a short and common word like _**“pear”**_ is a single token. Many tokens start with a whitespace, for example _**“ hello”**_ and _**“ bye”**_.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Language%20Models/img/tokens.png" width="726" height="96"/>

> Common words like _**“cat”**_ are a single token, while less common words are often broken down into multiple tokens. _For example,_ _**“Butterscotch”**_ translates to four tokens: _**“But”**_, _**“ters”**_, _**“cot”**_, and _**“ch”**_.

The number of tokens processed in a given API request depends on the length of both your inputs and outputs. As a rough rule of thumb, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words for English text. One limitation to keep in mind is that your text prompt and generated completion combined must be no more than the model's maximum context length (for most models this is 2048 tokens, or about 1500 words). Check out [tokenizer tool](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer) to learn more about how text translates to tokens.

### `text-davinci-003` model

> OpenAI releases a new language model for GPT-3 trained with human feedback (**November 2022**). It brings numerous improvements, according to OpenAI.

The new GPT-3 model `“text-davinci-003”` is based on the [InstructGPT](https://the-decoder.com/openai-million-dollar-investment-and-a-new-ai-model/) models introduced by OpenAI earlier this year, which are optimized with human feedback. These models have already shown that AI models trained with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) can achieve better results with the same or even lower parameters.

According to OpenAI alignment researcher Jan Leike, `“text-davinci-003”` is largely equivalent to the InstructGPT models, but is not identical. The new model “scores higher on human preference ratings without being fundamentally more capable” than the underlying base model. For fine-tuning, OpenAI required “very little compute and data to align it compared to pretraining”.

Leike points out that the new GPT model still has “important limitations” and, for example, sometimes simply makes up things. However, such missteps should now “hopefully” be less frequent and less serious.

`“text-davinci-003”` can generate **“clearer, more engaging, and more compelling content”** and handle **more complex instructions**, according to OpenAI.

`“text-davinci-003”` can also write longer texts, according to OpenAI. As a result, the language AI can now take on tasks that were previously unfeasible.

### `gpt-3.5-turbo` model 

> Read more about `gpt-3.5-turbo` model in [📂 Language Models - 🔸 Turbo](https://github.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/blob/master/Language%20Models/README.md#-turbo) folder

> Most capable GPT-3.5 model and optimized for chat at 1/10th the cost of text-davinci-003. Will be updated with our latest model iteration.

While the new gpt-3.5-turbo model is optimized for chat, it works very well for traditional completion tasks. 

Turbo is the same model family that powers ChatGPT. It is optimized for conversational chat input and output but does equally well on completions when compared with the Davinci model family. Any use case that can be done well in ChatGPT should perform well with the Turbo model family in the API.

The Turbo model family is also the first to receive regular model updates like ChatGPT.

###  ⚙️ Fine-tuning model

> Read all details about **Fine-tuning GPT-3 model** in 📂 [Language Models - ⚙️ Fine-tuning](https://github.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/blob/master/Language%20Models/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-fine-tuning-model) folder

Fine-tuning lets you get more out of the models available through the API by providing:

1. Higher quality results than prompt design
2. Ability to train on more examples than can fit in a prompt
3. Token savings due to shorter prompts
4. Lower latency requests

- 🔸 **Change prompt**

From → `Extract keywords from this text:`, to → `Extract keywords and key phrases from this text:`

💠 **Prompt Design**

This simple text-in, text-out interface means you can "program" the model by providing instructions or just a few examples of what you'd like it to do. Its success generally depends on the complexity of the task and the quality of your prompt. A good rule of thumb is to think about how you would write a word problem for a middle schooler to solve. A well-written prompt provides enough information for the model to know what you want and how it should respond.

GPT-3 models by OpenAI can do everything from generating original stories to performing complex text analysis. Because they can do so many things, you have to be explicit in describing what you want. Showing, not just telling, is often the secret to a good prompt.

**There are basic guidelines to creating prompts:**

- **Show and tell.** Make it clear what you want either through instructions, examples, or a combination of the two. If you want the model to rank a list of items in alphabetical order or to classify a paragraph by sentiment, show it that's what you want. 
- **Use plain language to describe your inputs and outputs.** As a best practice, start with plain language descriptions. While you can often use shorthand or keys to indicate the input and output, it's best to start by being as descriptive as possible and then working backwards to remove extra words and see if performance stays consistent
- **Provide quality data.** If you're trying to build a classifier or get the model to follow a pattern, make sure that there are enough examples. Be sure to proofread your examples — the model is usually smart enough to see through basic spelling mistakes and give you a response, but it also might assume this is intentional and it can affect the response. → that’s why you may need text pre-processing/cleaning and Grammatical Error Correction (GEC).
- **You need fewer examples for familiar tasks.** For Tweet sentiment classifier, you don't need to provide any examples. This is because the API already has an understanding of sentiment and the concept of a Tweet. If you're building a classifier for something the API might not be familiar with, it might be necessary to provide more examples.
- **Check your settings.** The `temperature` and `top_p` settings control how deterministic the model is in generating a response. If you're asking it for a response where there's only one right answer, then you'd want to set these lower. If you're looking for more diverse responses, then you might want to set them higher. The number one mistake people use with these settings is assuming that they're "cleverness" or "creativity" controls.

‼️ **Troubleshooting**

If you're having trouble getting the API to perform as expected, follow this checklist:
1. Is it clear what the intended generation should be?
2. Are there enough examples?
3. Did you check your examples for mistakes? (The API won't tell you directly)
4. Are you using `temperature` and `top_p` correctly?

💠 **Separator**

As a separator we can use `\nKeywords and Phrases:` which clearly separated the prompt from the completion. With a sufficient number of examples, the separator doesn't make much of a difference (usually less than 0.4%) as long as it doesn't appear within the prompt or the completion.

💠 **Conditional generation**

Conditional generation is a problem where the content needs to be generated given some kind of input. This includes paraphrasing, summarizing, entity extraction, product description writing given specifications, chatbots and many others. For this type of problem we recommend:

- Use a separator at the end of the prompt, e.g. `\n\n###\n\n`. Remember to also append this separator when you eventually make requests to your model.
- Use an ending token at the end of the completion, _e.g._ `END`
- Remember to add the ending token as a stop sequence during inference, _e.g._ `stop=[" END"]`
- Aim for at least ~500 examples
- Ensure that the prompt + completion doesn't exceed 2048 tokens, including the separator
- Ensure the examples are of high quality and follow the same desired format
- Ensure that the dataset used for finetuning is very similar in structure and type of task as what the model will be used for
- Using Lower learning rate and only 1-2 epochs tends to work better for these use cases

▶️ **_Case study: Write an engaging ad based on a Wikipedia article_**

This is a generative use case so you would want to ensure that the samples you provide are of the highest quality, as the fine-tuned model will try to imitate the style (and mistakes) of the given examples. A good starting point is around 500 examples. A sample dataset might look like this:

```
{"prompt":"<Product Name>\n<Wikipedia description>\n\n###\n\n", "completion":" <engaging ad> END"}
```

_For example:_

```
{"prompt":"Samsung Galaxy Feel\nThe Samsung Galaxy Feel is an Android smartphone developed by Samsung Electronics exclusively for the Japanese market. The phone was released in June 2017 and was sold by NTT Docomo. It runs on Android 7.0 (Nougat), has a 4.7 inch display, and a 3000 mAh battery.\nSoftware\nSamsung Galaxy Feel runs on Android 7.0 (Nougat), but can be later updated to Android 8.0 (Oreo).\nHardware\nSamsung Galaxy Feel has a 4.7 inch Super AMOLED HD display, 16 MP back facing and 5 MP front facing cameras. It has a 3000 mAh battery, a 1.6 GHz Octa-Core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU, and an ARM Mali-T830 MP1 700 MHz GPU. It comes with 32GB of internal storage, expandable to 256GB via microSD. Aside from its software and hardware specifications, Samsung also introduced a unique a hole in the phone's shell to accommodate the Japanese perceived penchant for personalizing their mobile phones. The Galaxy Feel's battery was also touted as a major selling point since the market favors handsets with longer battery life. The device is also waterproof and supports 1seg digital broadcasts using an antenna that is sold separately.\n\n###\n\n", "completion":"Looking for a smartphone that can do it all? Look no further than Samsung Galaxy Feel! With a slim and sleek design, our latest smartphone features high-quality picture and video capabilities, as well as an award winning battery life. END"}
```

Here we used a multi line separator, as Wikipedia articles contain multiple paragraphs and headings. We also used a simple end token, to ensure that the model knows when the completion should finish.

▶️ **_Case study: Entity extraction_**

This is similar to a language transformation task. To improve the performance, it is best to either sort different extracted entities alphabetically or in the same order as they appear in the original text. This will help the model to keep track of all the entities which need to be generated in order. The dataset could look as follows:

```
{"prompt":"<any text, for example news article>\n\n###\n\n", "completion":" <list of entities, separated by a newline> END"}
```

_For example:_

```
{"prompt":"Portugal will be removed from the UK's green travel list from Tuesday, amid rising coronavirus cases and concern over a \"Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant\". It will join the amber list, meaning holidaymakers should not visit and returnees must isolate for 10 days...\n\n###\n\n", "completion":" Portugal\nUK\nNepal mutation\nIndian variant END"}
```

A multi-line separator works best, as the text will likely contain multiple lines. Ideally there will be a high diversity of the types of input prompts (news articles, Wikipedia pages, tweets, legal documents), which reflect the likely texts which will be encountered when extracting entities.

- 🔸 **Temperature**

> See more details and examples in 📂 [Language Models](https://github.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/Language%20Models#fine-tuning-model) folder

Remember that the model predicts which text is most likely to follow the text preceding it. Temperature is a value between 0 and 1 that essentially lets you control how confident the model should be when making these predictions. Lowering temperature means it will take fewer risks, and completions will be more accurate and deterministic. Increasing temperature will result in more diverse completions.

It’s usually best to set a low temperature for tasks where the desired output is well-defined. Higher temperature may be useful for tasks where variety or creativity are desired, or if you'd like to generate a few variations for your end users or human experts to choose from.

‼️ The actual completion you see may differ because the API is stochastic by default. This means that you might get a slightly different completion every time you call it, even if your prompt stays the same. You can control this behavior with the [temperature](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature) setting.

- [How to sample from language models](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277)

### 💭 Conclusions

- The same `temperature` value generated different amounts of words and different words and phrases.
- This model is very sensitive to the input end, which influences the tokenization and consequently affects the extracted keywords.
    > **Warning:** Your text ends in a trailing space, which causes worse performance due to how the API splits text into tokens.
- It’s also worth taking note of the rather high `temperature` value and shorter max tokens. 
- Each time model generates text of different lengths. Setting up `max_tokens` doesn’t guarantee that text would be this length.
- Words in upper case are divided wrong into the tokens (e.g. FEBRUARY, CUISINE, RESEARCH, MENU, etc.). It is necessary to reduce all words to lowercase or to the form of ordinary sentences, where only the capital letter in the word is large.

# 🔺 Evaluation Metrics

- F<sub>1</sub>, Precision and Recall
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) 
- MAP (Mean Average Precision)
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) 
- Extracting the percentage of shared words between two texts
- **_Text Similarity Evaluation Metrics for Keywords Extraction:_**
  - Jaccard Index
  - Euclidean Distance
  - Cosine Similarity
  - Word Mover’s Distance
- 

Evaluating a Keyword Extraction model is not as straightforward as it is to evaluate a model for a [Classification](https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/#:~:text=Classification%20is%20a%20task%20that,”%20or%20“not%20spam.”) problem. Keyword extraction is fundamentally a ranking task rather than a classification task, where we would expect to rank relevant keywords or key phrases higher in order than irrelevant key phrases. When it comes to the evaluation of such systems we have to compare two lists of key phrases. Traditional tasks such as classification tasks just predict which class a sample belongs to and therefore, do not consider any form of ranking during evaluation. Keyword extraction on the other hand requires [Rank-Aware evaluation metrics](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/recommender-metrics/rank-aware-top-n-metrics-Wk98r).

## 💠 F<sub>1</sub>, Precision and Recall

The inherent assumption when using F<sub>1</sub>, Precision and Recall is that Keyword Extraction is considered as a classification problem. Here we consider a document as a set of tokens. The two classes are whether a token or a set of tokens is a keyword or not a keyword.

This inherent assumption makes this evaluation metric slightly weaker because Keyword Extraction is majorly a Ranking problem rather than a Classification problem. F<sub>1</sub>, Precision and Recall are considered as rank-less metrics because they do not address the ranks of the keywords at all.

Generally these metrics are not targeted to top-K extracted key-phrases. These can be bounded to top-K in the form of _Precision@K_ and _Recall@K_. Their harmonic mean gives _F1@K_. _Precision@K_ gives the percentage of the Top-K extracted key-phrases that are relevant. This does involve some sense on Top-K evaluation, but they still do not evaluate considering the rank. 

To understand the shortcomings of this approach let us consider the figure below which shows _list_1_ as the output of one of our models (model A) and _list_2_ as the output of another different (model B).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Keywords%20and%20Phrases%20Extraction/img/F1_metrics_keywords_extraction.webp" width="808" height="243"/>

Both the models extract 6 relevant and 4 irrelevant key-phrases and therefore have a score of _0.6 Precision@10_. But model B seems better because it extracts relevant key-phrases higher up the order as compared to model 1. Therefore we need metrics that are able to capture such differences as well.

- The **precision** is the ratio `tp / (tp + fp)` where `tp` is the number of **true positives** and `fp` the number of **false positives**. The precision is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label a negative sample as positive.
- The **recall** is the ratio `tp / (tp + fn)` where `tp` is the number of **true positives** and `fn` the number of **false negatives**. The recall is intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

```python
# split the extracted keywords and phrases into a list of individual keywords
extracted_list = extracted.split(" ")

# split the correct keywords and phrases into a list of individual keywords
correct_list = correct.split(" ")

# calculate the true positives, false positives, and false negatives
tp = len(set(extracted_list) & set(correct_list))
fp = len(set(extracted_list) - set(correct_list))
fn = len(set(correct_list) - set(extracted_list))

# calculate the precision, recall, and F1-score
precision = tp / (tp + fp)
recall = tp / (tp + fn)

  f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
except:
  f1_score = 0

# print the results
print("True Positive:", tp)
print("False Positive:", fp)
print("False Negatives:", fn, "\n\n")
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1-score:", f1_score)
```

These metrics are good at evaluating if we are good at finding relevant key-phrases but we need metrics that evaluate if we are good at finding and ranking relevant key-phrases. What this means is that given two models, we would like the metric to be able to differentiate between the two models based on which model extracts relevant key-phrases higher up the order. Therefore we need metrics such as **Mean Reciprocal Rank, Mean Average Precision (MAP) and nDCG** that allows us to evaluate the quality of the keywords generated based on their Ranks as well.

## 💠 Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

Mean Reciprocal Rank is a measure to evaluate models that return a ranked list of key-phrases to documents. MRR only cares about the single highest-ranked relevant item. If the model returns a relevant key-phrase in the third-highest spot, then that’s what MRR cares about. It doesn’t care if the other relevant key-phrases (assuming there are any) are ranked number 4 or number 20.

MRR gives the averaged ranking of the first correct prediction

Where, _**d**_ is the number of documents and _**rank<sub>i</sub>**_ is the rank at which the first correct key-phrase of document _**i**_ was found. Consider the example below which shows the computation of MRR over a dataset with 3 documents:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Keywords%20and%20Phrases%20Extraction/img/MRR_keywords_extraction.webp" width="933" height="384"/>

### Pros and Cons

➕ **Pros:**

- Therefore, MRR is appropriate to judge a model when either:
  - There’s only one relevant key-phrase.
  - Or, only the highest-ranked key-phrase is needed.

➖ **Cons:**

- If multiple key-phrases are expected and needs to be evaluated then this is not a good evaluation metric.
- It gives an extracted key-phrase list with a single relevant key-phrase the same weight as the same with multiple relevant key-phrases.

## 💠 Mean Average Precision (MAP)

We previously saw _Precision@K_ metric which used to give the percentage of relevant key-phrases among the top _K_ extracted key-phrases. The drawback of this approach was that it does not consider the extracted list of key-phrases as an ordered list. In other words, it doesn’t evaluate considering the ranks at which relevant key-phrases are extracted.

The goal is to come up with a metric that penalizes if irrelevant key-phrases are extracted higher up the order and gradually decrease the significance of the errors (extraction of irrelevant key-phrase) as we go down the list of extracted key-phrases. Mean Average Precision does just that. Here is how Mean Average Precision is calculated:

1. For each document:
    - For each relevant key-phrase in the list of extracted key-phrases:
      - Compute precision of the list till that relevant key-phrase.
    - Average sub-list precision scores
2. Finally take the mean of all the Average Precision scores for all the documents.

Let’s visualize this process:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Keywords%20and%20Phrases%20Extraction/img/MAP_keywords_extraction.webp" width="933" height="457"/>

### Pros and Cons

➕ **Pros:**

- Naturally considers the ranking aspect in the evaluation.
- Penalizes more when irrelevant key-phrases are extracted higher up the list as compared to further down the list.

➖ **Cons:**

- Works really well when there are only binary ratings (relevant/irrelevant). That is when all relevant or irrelevant key-phrases are equally relevant or irrelevant respectively. If fine-grained numerical ratings are involved, that is if there is levels of relevance or irrelevance then this metric fails to evaluate on this fine-grained information.
- If fine-grained numerical ratings are involved then in order to use this metric, we have make the relevancy binary based on some thresholding.

## 💠 Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG)

Just as MAP, nDCG also aims at valuing a relevant key-phrase higher up the predicted list. However, nDCG goes one step further and is able to use the fact that some key-phrases might be more relevant than the others. Therefore it also evaluates based on whether highly relevant key-phrases occur before the key-phrases with medium or low relevance.

First step in calculating nDCG involves calculation of Discounted Cumulative Gain(DCG). DCG aims at capturing the effectiveness of an algorithm by penalizing when highly relevant key-phrases appear lower in the result list. DCG accumulated till a particular rank _**k**_ is given by:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Keywords%20and%20Phrases%20Extraction/img/Discounted_Cumulative_Gain_formula.webp" width="402" height="116"/>

Here _**rel<sub>i</sub>**_ is the graded relevance of key-phrase at position _**i**_. The denominator serves a logarithmic reduction factor to penalize in proportion to the position of the results.

Depending on various factors, the number of predicted key-phrases may vary for every document, which makes DCG not comparable for all the documents. nDCG provides a score which has a proper upper and lower bounds so that we can take a mean across all the result scores to report a final score. This is done using normalization by determining the ideal ranking of key-phrases to in-turn determine the Ideal DCG.

To compute nDCG, for any key-phrase prediction, we have to compute:

- The DCG of the prediction.
- The DCG of the gold key-phrases, which would give the maximum DCG. This would be the Ideal DCG (IDCG).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Keywords%20and%20Phrases%20Extraction/img/nDCG_formula.webp" width="318" height="89"/>

The value of nDCG would range between 0 and 1. Let’s visualize the nDCG computation in the figure below for a single document when the output of the extracted key-phrases also contain the relevancy ratings.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Keywords%20and%20Phrases%20Extraction/img/nDCG_keywords_extraction.webp" width="915" height="521"/>

To compute the nDCG for multiple documents, simply take the mean of the nDCG of the individual key-phrase predictions of all the documents.

### Pros and Cons

➕ **Pros:**

- nDCG is a good choice of evaluation metric when graded relevance values are available in your dataset. The primary reason for choosing this metric is to take the graded relevance values into account.
- It is better than MAP in terms of evaluating the position of ranked key-phrases.

➖ **Cons:**

- It does not penalize for false positives, predictions that aren’t relevant. However this can be adjusted by using negative relevance for bad key-phrases in the results.

## 💠 Extracting the percentage of shared words between two texts

```python
def percent_shared(s1, s2):
    
    s_1 = set(s1.split())
    s_2 = set(s2.split())

    shared_words = s_1 & s_2
    diverging_words = s_1 ^ s_2
    total_words = s_1 | s_2
    assert len(total_words) == len(shared_words) + len(diverging_words)
    
    percent_shared = 100 * len(shared_words) / len(total_words)
    percent_diverging = 100 * len(diverging_words) / len(total_words)
    
    percent_to_s1 = round(len(shared_words) * 100 / len(s_1), 2)
    percent_to_s2 = round(len(shared_words) * 100 / len(s_2), 2)
    
    print(f"Together, extracted and correct keywords contain {len(total_words)} "
          f"unique words. \n{percent_shared:.2f}% of these words are "
          f"shared. \n{percent_diverging:.2f}% of these words diverge.\n")

    print("Overlap words -- ", len(shared_words))
    print('Percent to s1 keywords -- ', percent_to_s1, "%")
    print('Percent to s2 keywords -- ', percent_to_s2, "%")
```

## 📃 Text Similarity Evaluation Metrics

Text similarity has to determine how ‘close’ two pieces of text are both in surface closeness [lexical similarity] and meaning [semantic similarity].

For instance, how similar are the phrases _**“the cat ate the mouse”**_ with _**“the mouse ate the cat food”**_ by just looking at the words?

- On the surface, if you consider only **word level similarity**, these two phrases appear very similar as 3 of the 4 unique words are an exact overlap. It typically does not take into account the actual meaning behind words or the entire phrase in context.
- Instead of doing a **word for word comparison**, we also need to pay attention to context in order to capture more of the semantics. To consider semantic similarity we need to focus on **phrase/paragraph levels (or lexical chain level)** where a piece of text is broken into a relevant group of related words prior to computing similarity. We know that while the words significantly overlap, these two phrases actually have **different meaning**.

### Understanding Similarity

Similarity is the distance between two vectors where the vector dimensions represent the features of two objects. In simple terms, similarity is the measure of how different or alike two data objects are. If the distance is small, the objects are said to have a high degree of similarity and vice versa. Generally, it is measured in the range 0 to 1. This score in the range of [0, 1] is called the similarity score.

An important point to remember about similarity is that it’s subjective and highly dependent on the domain and use case.

### 💠 Similarity Measures

#### 🔹 Jaccard Index

Jaccard index, also known as Jaccard similarity coefficient, treats the data objects like sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union. Let’s continue with our previous example:

- **Sentence 1:** `The bottle is empty.`
- **Sentence 2:** `There is nothing in the bottle.`

To calculate the similarity using Jaccard similarity, we will first perform text normalization to reduce words their roots/lemmas. There are no words to reduce in the case of our example sentences, so we can move on to the next part. Drawing a Venn diagram of the sentences we get:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/Jaccard_Index.png" width="375" height="223"/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/Jaccard_Index_formula.png" width="400" height="108"/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/Jaccard_Index_formula_2.png" width="317" height="159"/>

- _Size of the intersection of the two sets:_ **3**
- _Size of the union of the two sets:_ **1+3+3 = 7**
- _Using the Jaccard index, we get a similarity score of_ **3/7 = 0.42**

```python
def jaccard_similarity(x,y):
  """ returns the jaccard similarity between two lists """
  intersection_cardinality = len(set.intersection(*[set(x), set(y)]))
  union_cardinality = len(set.union(*[set(x), set(y)]))
  return intersection_cardinality/float(union_cardinality)
```

#### 🔹 Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance, or L2 norm, is the most commonly used form of the [Minkowski distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance). Generally speaking, when people talk about distance, they refer to Euclidean distance. It uses the Pythagoras theorem to calculate the distance between two points as indicated in the figure below:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/Pythagoras_theorem.png" width="375" height="225"/>

The larger the distance d between two vectors, the lower the similarity score and vice versa. 

Let’s compute the similarity between our example statements using Euclidean distance:

```python
from math import sqrt, pow, exp
 
def squared_sum(x):
  """ return 3 rounded square rooted value """
 
  return round(sqrt(sum([a*a for a in x])),3)
 
def euclidean_distance(x,y):
  """ return euclidean distance between two lists """
 
  return sqrt(sum(pow(a-b,2) for a, b in zip(x, y)))
```

To compute the Euclidean distance we need vectors, so we’ll use spaCy’s in-built Word2Vec model to create text embeddings. 

```python
embeddings = [nlp(sentence).vector for sentence in sentences]

distance = euclidean_distance(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
print(distance)

# OUTPUT
1.8646982721454675
```

Okay, so we have the Euclidean distance of 1.86, but what does that mean? See, the problem with using distance is that it’s hard to make sense if there is nothing to compare to. The distances can vary from 0 to infinity, we need to use some way to normalize them to the range of 0 to 1.

Although we have our typical normalization formula that uses mean and standard deviation, it is sensitive to outliers. That means if there are a few extremely large distances, every other distance will become smaller as a consequence of the normalization operation. So the best option here is to use something like the Euler’s constant as follows: **1/e<sup>d</sup>**

```python

def distance_to_similarity(distance):
  return 1/exp(distance)

distance_to_similarity(distance) 

# OUTPUT
0.8450570465624478
```

#### 🔹 Cosine Similarity

Cosine Similarity computes the similarity of two vectors as the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. So if the angle between the vectors is 0 degrees, then the cosine similarity is 1. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/Cosine_Similarity.png" width="375" height="189"/>

It is given as:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/Cosine_Similarity_formula.png" width="356" height="175"/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/Cosine_Similarity_formula_2.png" width="533" height="139"/>

Where **||v||** represents the length of the vector **v**, **𝜃** denotes the angle between **v** and **w**, and **‘.’** denotes the dot product operator.

```python
def cos_similarity(x,y):

  '''return cosine similarity between two lists'''
 
  numerator = sum(a*b for a,b in zip(x,y))
  denominator = squared_sum(x)*squared_sum(y)
  return round(numerator/float(denominator),3)

cos_similarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])

# OUTPUT
0.891
```

- The implementation of Cosine Similarity in Python using TF-IDF vector of Scikit-learn:

```python
# Let's import text feature extraction TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Import Cosien Similarity metric
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity


docs=['I like dogs.', 'I hate dogs.']

# Create TFidfVectorizer 
tfidf= TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the documents 
tfidf_vector = tfidf.fit_transform(docs)

# Compute cosine similarity
cosine_sim=cosine_similarity(tfidf_vector, tfidf_vector)

# Print the cosine similarity
print(cosine_sim)
```

- Cosine Similarity using **Spacy**

We can also use cosine using [Spacy](https://machinelearninggeek.com/text-analytics-for-beginners-using-python-spacy-part-1/) similarity method:

```python
import en_core_web_sm

nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()

## try medium or large spacy english models

doc1 = nlp("I like apples.")

doc2 = nlp("I like oranges.")

# cosine similarity
doc1.similarity(doc2) 
```

- Cosine Similarity using **Scipy**

We can also implement using Scipy:

```python
from scipy import spatial

# Document Vectorization
doc1, doc2 = nlp('I like apples.').vector, nlp('I like oranges.').vector

# Cosine Similarity
result = 1 - spatial.distance.cosine(doc1, doc2)

print(result)
```

```python
# Cosine Similarity - Spacy
import spacy
import en_core_web_sm

# Load English tokenizer, tagger, parser and NER
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def cosine_similarity_spacy(s1, s2):
    s_1 = nlp(s1)
    s_2 = nlp(s2)
    return s_1.similarity(s_2)


# Cosine Similarity - Scipy
from scipy import spatial

def cosine_similarity_scipy(s1, s2):
    # Document Vectorization
    s_1 = nlp(s1).vector
    s_2 = nlp(s2).vector
    return 1 - spatial.distance.cosine(s_1, s_2)
    
# CountVectorizer Method + Cosine Similarity
def cosine_distance_countvectorizer_method(s1, s2):
    
    # sentences to list
    allsentences = [s1 , s2]
    
    # packages
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
    from scipy.spatial import distance
    
    # text to vector
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    all_sentences_to_vector = vectorizer.fit_transform(allsentences)
    text_to_vector_v1 = all_sentences_to_vector.toarray()[0].tolist()
    text_to_vector_v2 = all_sentences_to_vector.toarray()[1].tolist()
    
    # distance of similarity
    cosine = distance.cosine(text_to_vector_v1, text_to_vector_v2)
    print('Similarity of two sentences are equal to ',round((1-cosine)*100,2),'%')
    return cosine
```

Cosine similarity is best suitable for where repeated words are more important and can work on any size of the document.

#### 🔹 Word Mover’s Distance

WMD uses the **word embeddings of the words in two texts to measure the minimum distance** that the words in one text need to “travel” in semantic space to reach the words in the other text.

**🛠️ Implementation**

## ❓What Metric To Use?

Jaccard similarity takes into account only the set of unique words for each text document. This makes it the likely candidate for assessing the similarity of documents when repetition is not an issue. A prime example of such an application is comparing product descriptions. For instance, if a term like _“HD”_ or _“thermal efficiency”_ is used multiple times in one description and just once in another, the Euclidean distance and cosine similarity would drop. On the other hand, if the total number of unique words stays the same, the Jaccard similarity will remain unchanged. 

Both Euclidean and cosine similarity metrics drop if an additional _‘empty’_ is added to our first example sentence:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/master/Text%20Similarity/img/example.png" width="492" height="167"/>

Jaccard similarity is rarely used when working with text data as it does not work with text embeddings. This means that is limited to assessing the lexical similarity of text, i.e., how similar documents are on a word level.

As far as cosine and Euclidean metrics are concerned, the differentiating factor between the two is that cosine similarity is not affected by the magnitude/length of the feature vectors. Let’s say we are creating a topic tagging algorithm. If a word _(e.g. senate)_ occurs more frequently in document 1 than it does in document 2,  we could assume that document 1 is more related to the topic of _Politics_. However, it could also be the case that we are working with news articles of different lengths. Then, the word _‘senate’_ probably occurred more in document 1 simply because it was way longer. As we saw earlier when the word _‘empty’_ was repeated, cosine similarity is less sensitive to a difference in lengths.

In addition to that, Euclidean distance doesn’t work well with the sparse vectors of text embeddings. **So cosine similarity is generally preferred over Euclidean distance when working with text data.** The only length-sensitive text similarity use case that comes to mind is plagiarism detection.

# 💡 Ideas

- Run the model with different `temperature` values and join results together to achieve more extracted keywords. 
- Run the model with different `temperature` values and count how many words are generated with each.
- Reduce all words to lowercase or to the form of ordinary sentences, where only the capital letter in the word is large.
- Clean texts to make them more structured and coherent.
- **Chunk/divide the input text:** divide the text into several smaller ones and make a keywords extraction for each of them separately and then combine it into one concatenated keywords list.
- Make chunking of documents, try and compare the results of summarization of **different GPT-3 models**: `text-davinci-003`, `text-curie-001`, `text-babbage-001` and `text-ada-001`.

# ❓ Questions

- How to evaluate results?

  > It is of extreme importance that one understands the different evaluation metrics and when to use them. Evaluating your model on inadequate metrics and then judging your model based on the improvements achieved on these metrics is a huge trap. Often, especially in the Industry, these metrics are indicators for productionization of newer models. Therefore, as a Data Scientist, one should be aware of the pros and cons of different evaluation metrics in order to avoid falling into this trap.
