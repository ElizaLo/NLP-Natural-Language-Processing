## Classification of Word Embeddings

### Count based Vector space model (Non-semantic)

- Bag-of-words model

> **Vector space model** or **term vector model** is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as vectors of identifiers (such as index terms). It is used in **_information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings_**. 
> **Semantics:** In linguistics, semantics is the subfield that studies meaning. Semantics can address meaning at the levels of words, phrases, sentences, or larger units of [discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse).

## Bag-of-words model

In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the [bag (multiset)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.

### Count Vectorizer

CountVectorizer tokenizes(tokenization means dividing the sentences in words) the text along with performing very basic preprocessing. It removes the punctuation marks and converts all the words to lowercase.
The vocabulary of known words is formed which is also used for encoding unseen text later.
An encoded vector is returned with a length of the entire vocabulary and an integer count for the number of times each word appeared in the document. The image below shows what I mean by the encoded vector.

> Count Vectorizer sparse matrix representation of words. (a) is how you visually think about it. (b) is how it is really represented in practice.

The row of the above matrix represents the document, and the columns contain all the unique words with their frequency. In case a word did not occur, then it is assigned zero correspondings to the document in a row.
Imagine it as a one-hot encoded vector and due to that, it is pretty obvious to get a sparse matrix with a lot of zeros.

|[SentEval: evaluation toolkit for sentence embeddings](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval)|SentEval is a library for evaluating the quality of sentence embeddings. We assess their generalization power by using them as features on a broad and diverse set of "transfer" tasks. SentEval currently includes 17 downstream tasks. We also include a suite of 10 probing tasks which evaluate what linguistic properties are encoded in sentence embeddings. Our goal is to ease the study and the development of general-purpose fixed-size sentence representations.|
|[HMTL (Hierarchical Multi-Task Learning model)](https://github.com/huggingface/hmtl)|HMTL is a Hierarchical Multi-Task Learning model which combines a set of four carefully selected semantic tasks (namely Named Entity Recoginition, Entity Mention Detection, Relation Extraction and Coreference Resolution). The model achieves state-of-the-art results on Named Entity Recognition, Entity Mention Detection and Relation Extraction. Using [SentEval](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval), we show that as we move from the bottom to the top layers of the model, the model tend to learn more complex semantic representation.|
