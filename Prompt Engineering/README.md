# 💠 Prompt Types

- Selection-inference prompting
- Maieutic prompting

If your task involves logical reasoning or complexity, you may need to take additional steps to build more reliable prompts. For some helpful suggestions, consult our [Techniques to improve reliability](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/techniques_to_improve_reliability.md) guide. Overall the recommendations revolve around:
- Decomposing unreliable operations into smaller, more reliable operations (e.g., [selection-inference prompting](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/techniques_to_improve_reliability.md#selection-inference-prompting))
- Using multiple steps or multiple relationships to make the system's reliability greater than any individual component (e.g., [maieutic prompting](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/techniques_to_improve_reliability.md#maieutic-prompting))
