Planta is certainly aboard, though similar to a number of other meat-free restaurants, Planta prefers to avoid the \"vword\" (vegan), is careful to not alienate meat eaters, and instead describes itself as a plant-forward concept. Unlike some plant-based concepts that simply swap out burgers or steaks with tofu or other meat substitutes like tempeh, Planta takes a different approach in showcasing the versatility of vegetables in creative dishes, making them the star of the show (\"crab\" cakes made from hearts of palm, eggplant lasagna). Planta has succeeded in attracting both omnivores and herbivores, catering successfully to those following the flexitarian trend. The Star says Planta \"proves plants are posh,\" serving up unique renditions of classic foods like the 18-Carrot Dog that features smoky carrots dressed to the Twitch ballpark mustard and pickle spears. Chef David Lee's menu also leverages vegetables to showcase flavours from across the globe – take inspiration from Kimchi Spring Rolls or Chickpea Curry. The original Planta restaurant, located in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, opened in late 2016. The next year, the plant-based concept opened a fast-casual offshoot called Planta Burger.

Juice flavours range from Matcha Moringa Mylk (combines cashew milk, agave, lucuma, matcha powder, moringa powder, vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg) to ColdBrew Latte (made simply with cold brew coffee and vanilla almond milk). Common breakfast dishes like granola also get a healthy spin from buckwheat, an ancient grain that’s gluten-free, contains all eight essential amino acids and has grown more than 10% on U.S.menus in the past year alone (Datassential MenuTrends ). Last year JuiceBrothers partnered with the Brooklyn -based ice cream chain Van Leeuwen to offer vegan ice cream at the newest JuiceBrothers location in Amsterdam for a limited time.

    "          '''Your guide to Chicago’s hottest new restaurants ahead of the National Restaurant Association show. White Oak Tavern Sink | Swim Boeufhaus 2 MAY 2015 DINE AROUND: CHICAGO Last year Datassential took you to the on-trend neighborhood of Logan Square ahead of the 2014 National Restaurant Association Show, and now we are once again taking you on an immersion tour of Chicago. But this year we are taking you to the city's newest restaurants opened in 2014 or 2015. These are the cutting-edge restaurant concepts taking advantage of the hottest trends. Chicago has long been known as a centre of culinary innovation, with chefs like Grant Achatz and the late Homaro Cantu pushing the envelope and redefining the American plate. And this issue is full of restaurants that take chances. At Intro they are taking a chance with a new chef every few months, allowing them full reign over the menu. At Duck Inn, they are taking a chance that Chicago's working-class Bridgeport neighbourhood will embrace an adventurous, fine dining menu filled with dishes like potted foie gras with guava jelly or rice cake fingers with kimchi sauce as a bar snack. At Baker Miller they are taking a chance that customers will embrace the house-milled grains and flours they use in their baked goods, giving them control over the flavour and texture, even if it comes at a higher cost. And you'll find a variety of adventurous dishes and ingredients in this issue, inviting you to take a chance on something new – chicken hearts at Momotaro, makgeolli (Korean rice wine) at Parachute, corned pig tongue at Tete Charcuterie, or a whole pig's head for two at Charlatan. You can take a chance on a new cuisine, like the Piemontese -focused Osteria Langhe or the Basque-inspired Salero and mfk, or a new concept, like the beer cafe Beermiscuous. Or go for broke with some of the city's over-the-top creations -- the 5 lb. bacon bomb at Kaiser Tiger, or the $195.00 porterhouse at RPM Steak. Of course, Chicago is also home to the type of comforting, crowd-pleasing restaurants that the Midwest is known for – hearty chicken paprikash at Bohemian House, filling Tex -Mex at updated diner Dove's Luncheonette, inventive pizzas at Parlor Pizza Bar, old-school Italian at Formento's, or a whole roasted chicken from River Roast. We also bring you extensive consumer data on the concepts found in this issue and the dishes found on Chicago restaurant menus. And we have included a handy fast casual directory in the back: a curated list of some of the notable fast-casual concepts found in Chicago, one of which may just be the next big thing. Just in time for this month's 2015 National Restaurant Association Show, this special edition of Datassential's Dine Around takes you on a trendspotting immersion tour of Chicago, highlighting the newest restaurants, concepts, and trends in the city. If you are interested in learning more about how you can put food trends to work for you, ask us about meeting a Datassential representative while you are in town.''']"

      "['Plant-based cuisine continues to trend across the country (and around the world), with many operators jumping aboard the veggie train. Planta is certainly aboard, though similar to a number of other meat-free restaurants, Planta prefers to avoid the \"vword\" (vegan), is careful to not alienate meat eaters, and instead describes itself as a plant-forward concept. Unlike some plant-based concepts that simply swap out burgers or steaks with tofu or other meat substitutes like tempeh, Planta takes a different approach in showcasing the versatility of vegetables in creative dishes, making them the star of the show (\"crab\" cakes made from hearts of palm, eggplant lasagna). Planta has succeeded in attracting both omnivores and herbivores, catering successfully to those following the flexitarian trend. The Star says Planta \"proves plants are posh,\" serving up unique renditions of classic foods like the 18-Carrot Dog that features smoky carrots dressed to the Twitch ballpark mustard and pickle spears. Chef David Lee\\'s menu also leverages vegetables to showcase flavours from across the globe – take inspiration from Kimchi Spring Rolls or Chickpea Curry. The original Planta restaurant, located in Toronto\\'s Yorkville neighbourhood, opened in late 2016. The next year, the plant-based concept opened a fast-casual offshoot called Planta Burger. This year, Planta made the leap to the U.S., recently opening a restaurant in Miami\\'s South Beach.']\n"

In both cases, ingredients are displayed front and centre on the packaging to show off on-trend clean labels – according to our data, 41% of U.S.consumers believe it’s important that clean labels be placed on the front of packaging instead of the back. Across the menu, the chain’s products are organic and vegan. Juice flavours range from Matcha Moringa Mylk (combines cashew milk, agave, lucuma, matcha powder, moringa powder, vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg) to ColdBrew Latte (made simply with cold brew coffee and vanilla almond milk). Common breakfast dishes like granola also get a healthy spin from buckwheat, an ancient grain that’s gluten-free, contains all eight essential amino acids and has grown more than 10% on U.S.menus in the past year alone (Datassential MenuTrends ). Last year JuiceBrothers partnered with the Brooklyn -based ice cream chain Van Leeuwen to offer vegan ice cream at the newest JuiceBrothers location in Amsterdam for a limited time. The alternative ice cream was made using coconut milk, cashew milk, coconut oil, cane sugar, cocoa butter, and carob bean, and flavours included turmeric as well as trendy spirulina with pieces of matcha cake.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Plant-based cuisine continues to trend across the country (and around the world), with many operators jumping aboard the veggie train. Planta is certainly aboard, though similar to a number of other meat-free restaurants, Planta prefers to avoid the \"vword\" (vegan), is careful to not alienate meat eaters, and instead describes itself as a plant-forward concept. Unlike some plant-based concepts that simply swap out burgers or steaks with tofu or other meat substitutes like tempeh, Planta takes a different approach in showcasing the versatility of vegetables in creative dishes, making them the star of the show (\"crab\" cakes made from hearts of palm, eggplant lasagna). Planta has succeeded in attracting both omnivores and herbivores, catering successfully to those following the flexitarian trend. The Star says Planta \"proves plants are posh,\" serving up unique renditions of classic foods like the 18-Carrot Dog that features smoky carrots dressed to the Twitch ballpark mustard and pickle spears. Chef David Lee's menu also leverages vegetables to showcase flavours from across the globe – take inspiration from Kimchi Spring Rolls or Chickpea Curry. The original Planta restaurant, located in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, opened in late 2016. The next year, the plant-based concept opened a fast-casual offshoot called Planta Burger. This year, Planta made the leap to the U.S., recently opening a restaurant in Miami's South Beach.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Your guide to Chicago’s hottest new restaurants ahead of the National Restaurant Association show. White Oak Tavern Sink | Swim Boeufhaus 2 MAY 2015 DINE AROUND: CHICAGO Last year Datassential took you to the on-trend neighborhood of Logan Square ahead of the 2014 National Restaurant Association Show, and now we are once again taking you on an immersion tour of Chicago. But this year we are taking you to the city's newest restaurants opened in 2014 or 2015. These are the cutting-edge restaurant concepts taking advantage of the hottest trends. Chicago has long been known as a centre of culinary innovation, with chefs like Grant Achatz and the late Homaro Cantu pushing the envelope and redefining the American plate. And this issue is full of restaurants that take chances. At Intro they are taking a chance with a new chef every few months, allowing them full reign over the menu. At Duck Inn, they are taking a chance that Chicago's working-class Bridgeport neighbourhood will embrace an adventurous, fine dining menu filled with dishes like potted foie gras with guava jelly or rice cake fingers with kimchi sauce as a bar snack. At Baker Miller they are taking a chance that customers will embrace the house-milled grains and flours they use in their baked goods, giving them control over the flavour and texture, even if it comes at a higher cost. And you'll find a variety of adventurous dishes and ingredients in this issue, inviting you to take a chance on something new – chicken hearts at Momotaro, makgeolli (Korean rice wine) at Parachute, corned pig tongue at Tete Charcuterie, or a whole pig's head for two at Charlatan. You can take a chance on a new cuisine, like the Piemontese -focused Osteria Langhe or the Basque-inspired Salero and mfk, or a new concept, like the beer cafe Beermiscuous. Or go for broke with some of the city's over-the-top creations -- the 5 lb. bacon bomb at Kaiser Tiger, or the $195.00 porterhouse at RPM Steak. Of course, Chicago is also home to the type of comforting, crowd-pleasing restaurants that the Midwest is known for – hearty chicken paprikash at Bohemian House, filling Tex -Mex at updated diner Dove's Luncheonette, inventive pizzas at Parlor Pizza Bar, old-school Italian at Formento's, or a whole roasted chicken from River Roast. We also bring you extensive consumer data on the concepts found in this issue and the dishes found on Chicago restaurant menus. And we have included a handy fast casual directory in the back: a curated list of some of the notable fast-casual concepts found in Chicago, one of which may just be the next big thing. Just in time for this month's 2015 National Restaurant Association Show, this special edition of Datassential's Dine Around takes you on a trendspotting immersion tour of Chicago, highlighting the newest restaurants, concepts, and trends in the city. If you are interested in learning more about how you can put food trends to work for you, ask us about meeting a Datassential representative while you are in town.</th>\n",
