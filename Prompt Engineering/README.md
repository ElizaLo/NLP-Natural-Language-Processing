|[Prompt Engineering Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide)|This guide contains a non-exhaustive set of learning guides and tools about prompt engineering. It includes several materials, guides, examples, papers, and much more. The repo is intended to be used as a research and educational reference for practitioners and developers.|

# ðŸ’  Prompt Types

- Selection-inference prompting
- Maieutic prompting

If your task involves logical reasoning or complexity, you may need to take additional steps to build more reliable prompts. For some helpful suggestions, consult our [Techniques to improve reliability](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/techniques_to_improve_reliability.md) guide. Overall the recommendations revolve around:
- Decomposing unreliable operations into smaller, more reliable operations (e.g., [selection-inference prompting](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/techniques_to_improve_reliability.md#selection-inference-prompting))
- Using multiple steps or multiple relationships to make the system's reliability greater than any individual component (e.g., [maieutic prompting](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/techniques_to_improve_reliability.md#maieutic-prompting))
